#weather-API
 I recently built a weather API website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website show my home town current weather conditions. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data.

i am happy with the results of this project. I learned a lot about how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional website. I also learned how to use an API to get data from the internet. I am confident that I can use these skills to build other websites in the future.

Here are some of the challenges I faced while building the website:

Getting the weather data from the API was a bit challenging. I had to learn how to parse the JSON data that the API returned.
Making the website responsive was also a challenge. I had to use CSS media queries to make sure that the website looked good on different devices.

Overall, I am happy with the results of this project. I learned a lot and I am confident that I can use these skills to build other websites in the future.
